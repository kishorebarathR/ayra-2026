          AYRA is guided by a leadership team that believes education must be
          bold in vision, agile in execution, and deeply human in approach. Our
          leaders come from diverse backgrounds—across academia, industry,
          entrepreneurship, and social innovation—but are united by a shared
          mission: to build an institution that empowers students to think
          independently, learn differently, and lead authentically.

          This isn’t a boardroom-led institution. AYRA’s leadership is present,
          participatory, and student-focused. They don’t just shape
          policies—they shape culture. They don’t just uphold standards—they
          question them. And most importantly, they’re not afraid to reimagine
          what’s possible.
