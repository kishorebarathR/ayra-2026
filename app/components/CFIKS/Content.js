          The Centre for Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) is AYRA’s commitment to
          blending the wisdom of the past with the demands of the present.
          Rooted in the vision of the National Education Policy 2020, IKS draws
          from India’s vast heritage — in philosophy, science, ecology, health,
          and education — to complement and enrich contemporary disciplines.
          Offered as a credit-bearing course across all programs, it helps
          students and the wider community discover how ancient knowledge
          remains relevant, practical, and transformative.
